Dataset Name: spotifyStreams.csv

Data File Description: This is the joining of all datasets from Spotify on their global top 200 streamed songs of each week. A new dataset is created each week, so our dataset is created by a function that starts at the set date (perhaps presumed to be the current date, just not in the future or before late 2016) and collects a set number of weeks of these spotify datasets. Currently this is collecting all available data, because spotify only offers this data after the week of 12/29/2016. 

Columns:
	-Position: the position on the top 200 weekly global streams 
	-Track Name: name of the track that is listed
	-Artist: name of the artist
	-Streams: number of streams the listed track received that week
	-Week: concluding day of that week 

File Format: CSV or comma separated value file
